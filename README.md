This is the front-end implementation of a Bitcoin price analyzer.
This price analyzer displays a graph with the price trends of the Bitcoin.

It is set to display the last 24 hours by, a datepicker range filter allows the user to change the timeline range.

When the filter is changed, the graph is redrawn to reflect the new filter.

### Requirements

This application needs `Node v13.9` or later.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are managed via `npm` (or `yarn`).

To install the dependencies run at the root of the project:

```shell script
$ npm install
```

### For developpers

If you need a `proxy`, set it up in `package.json` so it points to the data API.

Make sure the `.env` set the API endpoint according to your environment.

You can start and run the app locally by running:

```shell script
$ npm start
```

### Deployment on production

Make sure the `homepage` field in `package.json` is matching the directory of your target.

Make sure the `.env` is set according to your environment.

Build the assets:

```shell script
$ npm build
```

Then copy all the files and folders that are inside the `build` directory to your public location.

`index.html` is the entry-point for the users.
